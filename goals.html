            <h2>🗺️ Basic Guidance to Know Yourself Deeper</h2>
            <p>Self-discovery is a practice, not a single event. Start with these fundamental steps:</p>

            <h3>1. The Practice of Observation (Mindfulness)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Journaling: Dedicate 10 minutes daily to writing freely about your thoughts, feelings, and reactions without judgment. Focus on the "why" behind your emotions.</li>
                <li>Emotional Check-Ins: Pause throughout the day and ask yourself: "How am I feeling right now?" and "Where do I feel this in my body?" This builds emotional literac*.</li>
                <li>Identify Triggers: Pay close attention to what causes strong reactions (positive or negative) in you. Your triggers reveal your unmet needs and core values.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Clarifying Your Values and Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>List Your Non-Negotiables: Write down the 5 things you believe are most important in life (e.g., God,integrity, freedom, family, creativity, service). When you make decisions, check if they align with these core values.</li>
                <li>Reflect on Past Successes: Think about a time you felt truly proud, energized, and competent. What specific skills were you using? (e.g., listening, problem-solving, organizing).</li>
                <li>Seek Feedback: Ask two trusted friends and two colleagues: "What do you think I am naturally good at?" and "What is my most dominant positive trait?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Experimentation and Action</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Try New Things: Step outside your comfort zone to discover unexpected interests. Take a class, visit a new place, or pick up a different hobby. 

</li>
                <li>Set Boundaries:Start small by saying "no" to one thing this week that you would normally agree to out of obligation. Setting boundaries helps define who you are not and protects your energy.</li>
                <li>Spend Time Alone:Create intentional time without distractions (phone, TV, others) to simply be with your thoughts. This quiet space is essential for internal reflection.</li>
            </ul>
